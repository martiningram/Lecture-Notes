## Meeting with Silvia, 23rd Jan 2015

People present: Casper, Martin

Notes:

* Silvia reckons we can do court line detection very efficiently. To do that,
  first find the lines using the Hough transform (no, she doesn't know how to
  pronounce either), which may take a bit of time, but then track _changes_
  rather than doing the full detection every time.
    * To do that, pick several points on the line, find the normal vector and
      search for maximum brightness along that line. Search within a reasonable
      space. Should not have to search too much as we have 60fps and so changes
      ought to be quite small.
    * We should only need three points to get the 3D. We should already be able
      to get four from the intersections of three detected lines (I think this
      is what she said, I don't quite remember), so we ought to be OK.
    * Silvia seems to have done a lot of work on the line detection because her
      work was based on looking at television footage where cameras move all the
      time, so the court has to be detected very often. She could be a very good
      contact for that (maybe interesting for James?)
* For ball tracking, she agreed that a Kalman filter would be worth looking
  into. (Martin: I'll give it a try).
* For player tracking, she suggests that George should go see her. Shadows are
  an issue. Background subtraction is a good idea, and she also said that
  optical flow may work, possibly even for ball tracking, but quite definitely
  for player tracking. Silvia is not too busy right now and happy to meet us
  quite often.
* When we get back onto the court, we could ask:
    1. Do they have a ball machine? This would be helpful for consistent shots,
	thus allowing us to test our algorithms. In general, Silvia mentioned that
	the coaches are very keen on working with us, so we shouldn't hesitate to
	ask them about playing in a specific way etc.
    2. Lasers: Casper mentioned we could test accuracy by placing lasers on the
       lines. There would be a laser on one side, and a receiver on the other;
       ideally, there would be two so that we could track both edges of the
       line. When the ball hits the line it will obscure the laser.
        * Note: This would profit from a ball machine since we need the ball to
       hit the line pretty much exactly, though maybe the coach is skilled
       enough to do that, too.
* CSG are helpful for setting up things. Silvia thinks we should go see them
  about getting OpenCV to work with CUDA.
* Silvia thinks it would definitely be nice to record some form of video
  together with the data of our analysis, hence she thinks a fifth camera is a
  good idea.
